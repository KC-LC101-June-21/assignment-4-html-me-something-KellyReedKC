      <caption> A commentary on two of my favorite things</caption>
      <p>Cactus's, or cacti, are awesome. They soak up the sun all year. You rarely or never even need to water them so they make a great house plant! I have quite a few. Soon I will be adding one to my collection that is almost seven feet tall! I love cacti because I feel like they soak up the sun and give it back to you in the winter.</p>

      <p> Mushrooms are also amazing. In the spring we hunt for morel mushrooms, in the summer we hunt for chanterelle mushrooms. Mostly I like to photograph mushrooms. There are tens of thousands of varieties. As most people know, some mushrooms can harm or even kill you if ingested, while some are completely safe to eat. Some are psychoactive.

         <sup>The coveted Amanita Muscaria featured in video games, emojis, and other poopular culture is highly psychoactive</sup>
       <p>Mushrooms are actually the fruit of a complex underground organism invisable to the human eye called mycelium. Mycelium is made of different metabollically active compunds under the soil. Mycelium resembles a huge web under the surface that is often times mutually beneficial to other plants. Some people estimate that up to ninety percent of the ground we walk on has a web of mycelium below.

      </p> The mushroom is the fruit of that web as mushrooms produce spores, which are able to drift or even catapult off of that mushroom like a seed, to create mushrooms in other places and thus survive as a species. When mycelium has a healthy supply of nutrients, you won't even know it is there. But as the nutrients are depleted, the mycelium mushrooms up to produce spores that will hopefully reach a place that has more nutrients. That is why often times we find mushrooms around things that are dying or rotting, such as decayed trees. </p>

      <sup>Morel mushrooms are highly sought after in the spring</sup>
      <p>Did you know mushroom spores are one of the toughest substances in our entire galaxy? They can survive high heat, freezing cold, and can even survive in the vacuum of space. Some people theorize mushrooms are from space! Part of why I love mushrooms is because of their strange, alien-like appearance. Seeing the odd variety of these specimins definitely conjures up images of what things may be like on a different planet... or even a different dimension. Over all I love these beautiful, inspiring organisms.</p>

      <sup>Sometimes it's hard to believe these strange organisms aren't from space. What do you think?</sup>
